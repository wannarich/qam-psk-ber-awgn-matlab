## üöÄ Getting Started
This guide will help you download and run the "qam-psk-ber-awgn-matlab" application on your computer. This software simulates Bit Error Rate (BER) versus Eb/N0 for digital modulation techniques like QPSK and 16-QAM using MATLAB. It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) demo with exportable plots.

## üì¶ System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **MATLAB**: Version 2018a or later.
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB RAM.
- **Disk Space**: Minimum of 100 MB available.

## üìÖ Features
- Simulate BER versus Eb/N0 for:
  - QPSK (4-QAM)
  - 8-PSK (Rectangular)
  - 16-QAM
- Command-line interface for easy usage.
- Export plots to various formats for analysis.

## üì• Download & Install
1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/wannarich/qam-psk-ber-awgn-matlab/releases) to download the software.
2. Locate the latest release.
3. Download the ZIP file containing the application.
4. Extract the files to a folder on your computer.

## üìã Running the Application
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Change the directory to the folder where you extracted the files:
   ```matlab
   cd 'path_to_your_folder'
   ```
3. Run the demo script using the command:
   ```matlab
   demo_script
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter parameters for the simulations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Using the Command-Line Interface
For advanced users, you can run the simulations directly from the command line. Here's how:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the application folder:
   ```bash
   cd path_to_your_folder
   ```
3. Execute the command:
   ```bash
   matlab -batch "run_simulation('parameter1', 'parameter2')"
   ```
Replace `parameter1` and `parameter2` with your chosen values.

## üìä Exporting Plots
After running the simulations:
1. Locate the generated plots in the output folder.
2. Use the export functionality in MATLAB to save your plots as PNG or PDF files for reporting or presentations.
